# Network Services



|           |       |             |
| --------- | ----- | ----------- |
| FTP       | SMB   | NFS         |
| IMAP/POP3 | SSH   | MySQL/MSSQL |
| RDP       | WinRM | VNC         |
| Telnet    | SMTP  | LDAP        |

The table above outlines a variety of protocols and services commonly used in network communication, system administration, and data transfer. Each service or protocol serves a specific purpose and operates over distinct ports, offering different levels of security, functionality, and complexity.

* **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: Used for transferring files between clients and servers on a network. It operates on ports 20 and 21.
* **SMB (Server Message Block)**: Protocol for network file sharing, printer sharing, and serial port sharing over a network. It operates commonly on TCP port 445.
* **NFS (Network File System)**: A distributed file system protocol allowing a user on a client computer to access files over a network similar to how local storage is accessed.
* **IMAP/POP3**: Used for retrieving emails from a server. IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) and POP3 (Post Office Protocol) are two different protocols for handling mail messages.
* **SSH (Secure Shell)**: A protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Default port is 22.
* **MySQL/MSSQL**: Database management systems. MySQL is open source whereas MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server) is a proprietary database server.
* **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)**: A proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection.
* **WinRM (Windows Remote Management)**: A protocol for remote management of Windows Servers.
* **VNC (Virtual Network Computing)**: Allows you to remotely access and control a computer over a network.
* **Telnet**: An application protocol used on the Internet or local area networks to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection. It operates on port 23.
* **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: A protocol for sending email messages between servers. Most email systems that send mail over the Internet use SMTP to send messages from one server to another.
* **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**: A protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

Understanding the functionality and specifics of these protocols and services is crucial for network administrators and IT professionals to ensure efficient and secure management of network resources and data.
