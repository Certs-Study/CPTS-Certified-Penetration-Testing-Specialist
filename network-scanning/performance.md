# ðŸŸ¢ Performance

Scanning performance plays a significant role when we need to scan an extensive network or are dealing with low network bandwidth. We can use various options to tell `Nmap` how fast (`-T <1-5>`), with which frequency (`--min-parallelism <number>`), which timeouts (`--max-rtt-timeout <time>`) the test packets should have, how many packets should be sent simultaneously (`--min-rate <number>`), and with the number of retries (`--max-retries <number>`) for the scanned ports the targets should be scanned.

### Timeouts

When Nmap sends a packet, it takes some time (`Round-Trip-Time` - `RTT`) to receive a response from the scanned port. Generally, `Nmap` starts with a high timeout (`--min-RTT-timeout`) of 100ms. Let us look at an example by scanning the whole network with 256 hosts, including the top 100 ports.

| Scanning Options             | Description                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `10.129.2.0/24`              | Scans the specified target network.                   |
| `-F`                         | Scans top 100 ports.                                  |
| `--initial-rtt-timeout 50ms` | Sets the specified time value as initial RTT timeout. |
| `--max-rtt-timeout 100ms`    | Sets the specified time value as maximum RTT timeout. |

### Timing

Because such settings cannot always be optimized manually, as in a black-box penetration test, `Nmap` offers six different timing templates (`-T <0-5>`) for us to use. These values (`0-5`) determine the aggressiveness of our scans. This can also have negative effects if the scan is too aggressive, and security systems may block us due to the produced network traffic. The default timing template used when we have defined nothing else is the normal (`-T 3`).

* `-T 0` / `-T paranoid`
* `-T 1` / `-T sneaky`
* `-T 2` / `-T polite`
* `-T 3` / `-T normal`
* `-T 4` / `-T aggressive`
* `-T 5` / `-T insane`
