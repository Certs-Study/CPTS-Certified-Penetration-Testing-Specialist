# ðŸŸ¢ Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion

## Easy Lab

Our client wants to know if we can identify which operating system their provided machine is running on. Submit the OS name as the answer.

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.142.18 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --source-port 53 -A
```

## Medium Lab

After the configurations are transferred to the system, our client wants to know if it is possible to find out our target's DNS server version. Submit the DNS server version of the target as the answer.

```
sudo nmap 10.129.2.48 -sT -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --source-port 53 -p 53 -sV
```

## Hard Lab

Now our client wants to know if it is possible to find out the version of the running services. Identify the version of service our client was talking about and submit the flag as the answer.

```
// Some code
```

### Nmap Arguments

```
FIREWALL/IDS EVASION AND SPOOFING:
  -f; --mtu <val>: fragment packets (optionally w/given MTU)
  -D <decoy1,decoy2[,ME],...>: Cloak a scan with decoys
  -S <IP_Address>: Spoof source address
  -e <iface>: Use specified interface
  -g/--source-port <portnum>: Use given port number
  --proxies <url1,[url2],...>: Relay connections through HTTP/SOCKS4 proxies
  --data <hex string>: Append a custom payload to sent packets
  --data-string <string>: Append a custom ASCII string to sent packets
  --data-length <num>: Append random data to sent packets
  --ip-options <options>: Send packets with specified ip options
  --ttl <val>: Set IP time-to-live field
  --spoof-mac <mac address/prefix/vendor name>: Spoof your MAC address
  --badsum: Send packets with a bogus TCP/UDP/SCTP checksum

```

### DNS Proxying

By default, `Nmap` performs a reverse DNS resolution unless otherwise specified to find more important information about our target. These DNS queries are also passed in most cases because the given web server is supposed to be found and visited. The DNS queries are made over the `UDP port 53`. The `TCP port 53` was previously only used for the so-called "`Zone transfers`" between the DNS servers or data transfer larger than 512 bytes. More and more, this is changing due to IPv6 and DNSSEC expansions. These changes cause many DNS requests to be made via TCP port 53.

However, `Nmap` still gives us a way to specify DNS servers ourselves (`--dns-server <ns>,<ns>`). This method could be fundamental to us if we are in a demilitarized zone (`DMZ`). The company's DNS servers are usually more trusted than those from the Internet. So, for example, we could use them to interact with the hosts of the internal network. As another example, we can use `TCP port 53` as a source port (`--source-port`) for our scans. If the administrator uses the firewall to control this port and does not filter IDS/IPS properly, our TCP packets will be trusted and passed through.

```
ncat -nv --source-port 53 10.129.2.28 50000
```
