# Encoding/Decoding

* `Spaces`: May indicate the end of request data if not encoded
* `&`: Otherwise interpreted as a parameter delimiter
* `#`: Otherwise interpreted as a fragment identifier

There are other types of URL-encoding, like `Full URL-Encoding` or `Unicode URL` encoding, which may also be helpful for requests with many special characters.
