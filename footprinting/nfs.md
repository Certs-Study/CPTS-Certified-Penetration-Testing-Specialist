| `NFSv2`     | It is older but is supported by many systems and was initially operated entirely over UDP.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `NFSv3`     | It has more features, including variable file size and better error reporting, but is not fully compatible with NFSv2 clients.                                                                                                                                       |
| `NFSv4`     | It includes Kerberos, works through firewalls and on the Internet, no longer requires portmappers, supports ACLs, applies state-based operations, and provides performance improvements and high security. It is also the first version to have a stateful protocol. |
