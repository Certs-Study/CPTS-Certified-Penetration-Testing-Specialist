### The Basics of SMTP

SMTP, the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, is a set of rules that govern how electronic mail is transmitted and received over the Internet. It's the standard protocol used for sending and relaying emails between servers. The process involves multiple components, one of which is the use of specific ports to facilitate communication.

### SMTP Ports Explained

Ports are communication endpoints in a computer network, and they enable data exchange between different applications. SMTP utilizes specific ports to handle various aspects of email communication. Let's take a closer look at the primary SMTP ports:

| Port Number | Description                 | Security    |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| 25          | Traditional SMTP Port       | Unencrypted |
| 587         | Submission Port             | StartTLS    |
| 465         | SSL/TLS Encrypted Port      | SSL/TLS     |
| 2525        | Unofficial Alternative Port | Unencrypted |

**Default Configuration**

```
cat /etc/postfix/main.cf | grep -v "#" | sed -r "/^\s*$/d"
```

### SMTP Commands

| Command      | Description                                                                                                               | Example                                                                                                                               |

| Content-Type | Defines the type and encoding of the email content.                                                                       | Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"                                                                                             |

Remember that when interacting with an SMTP server using these commands, each command should be followed by a newline character (CRLF) to properly terminate the command.

### Open Relay

```
sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p25 --script smtp-open-relay -v
```

### The Significance of Encryption

In today's cybersecurity landscape, data privacy and protection are paramount. SMTP supports encryption methods such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) to secure email transmissions. Encryption ensures that sensitive information, including email content and user credentials, remains encrypted and safe from prying eyes during transit.

### How to send an Email using Telnet?

```
telnet 10.129.14.128 25
```

### Footprinting the SMTP Service

```
sudo nmap 10.129.172.83 -sC -sV -p25
```

**Nmap - Open Relay**

```
sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p25 --script smtp-open-relay -v
```

### Enumerate SMTP Users

```
smtp-user-enum -M VRFY -U list.txt -t 10.129.172.83
```

Sometimes we may have to work through a web proxy. We can also make this web proxy connect to the SMTP server. The command that we would send than would look something like this:&#x20;

```
CONNECT 10.129.14.128:25 HTTP/1.0
```
