# ðŸŸ¢ IPMI

### &#x20;IPMI is typically used in three ways:

* Before the OS has booted to modify BIOS settings
* When the host is fully powered down
* Access to a host after a system failure

The IPMI protocol was first published by Intel in 1998 and is now supported by over 200 system vendors, including Cisco, Dell, HP, Supermicro, Intel, and more. Systems using IPMI version 2.0 can be administered via serial over LAN, giving sysadmins the ability to view serial console output in band.

### To function, IPMI requires the following components:

* Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - A micro-controller and essential component of an IPMI
* Intelligent Chassis Management Bus (ICMB) - An interface that permits communication from one chassis to another
* Intelligent Platform Management Bus (IPMB) - extends the BMC
* IPMI Memory - stores things such as the system event log, repository store data, and more
* Communications Interfaces - local system interfaces, serial and LAN interfaces, ICMB and PCI Management Bus

&#x20;Many BMCs (including HP iLO, Dell DRAC, and Supermicro IPMI) expose a web-based management console, some sort of command-line remote access protocol such as Telnet or SSH, and the port 623 UDP, which, again, is for the IPMI network protocol.&#x20;

Below is a sample Nmap scan using the Nmap [ipmi-version](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ipmi-version.html) NSE script to footprint the service.

```
sudo nmap -sU --script ipmi-version -p 623 ilo.inlanfreight.local
```
