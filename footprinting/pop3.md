# ðŸŸ¢ POP3

**POP3 Ports**

| Port Number | Description             | Protocol |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
| 110         | POP3 (Plain Text)       | TCP/UDP  |
| 995         | POP3 over SSL (TLS/SSL) | TCP      |

Please note that POP3 typically uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for communication, but the table also includes UDP (User Datagram Protocol) as some older implementations might use it. However, UDP is not commonly used for POP3.&#x20;

The secure version of POP3 (POP3S) utilizes SSL/TLS encryption to protect communications.
